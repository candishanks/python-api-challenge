# python-api-challenge

Random cities were generated. 

These cities were run through the weather API. From there, the data was cleaned, organized, and exported 
into a csv. All of this was done using Python and Pandas. 

This CSV was loaded into another Pandas file. From there, the data was turned into a CSV and 
and then run through the gmaps API. 

At this point, the data was run through to match with hotels and create visuals.
